# üöÄ Blogging Platform API

> A simple and efficient Blogging Platform API built using **Cookiecutter Django** and **Django REST Framework**. Focused on CRUD operations to manage blog posts effortlessly.

## üî• Tech Stack

- **Cookiecutter Django**: I used Cookiecutter Django to streamline the setup for this project. It comes with Docker, PostgreSQL, and environment management already configured, which helped me get started quickly while learning how these pieces fit together.
- **Django & Django REST Framework**: For this project, I wanted to explore Django and Django REST Framework. They provided a solid foundation for building a functional API with clean code and fast performance.
- **PostgreSQL**: I chose PostgreSQL for its reliability and scalability, and this project gave me hands-on experience working with it.
- **Docker**: Using Docker ensured that the project environment was easy to manage and deploy, which made the development process smoother, especially for testing across different setups.
- **Postman**: I tested the API thoroughly with Postman to ensure everything worked as expected. This was part of my learning process for debugging and refining API endpoints.

- **Built for clarity**:  In line with the requirements of the technical test, this project focuses solely on the core API functionalities without implementing pagination, authentication, or authorization. This makes the code straightforward and easier to follow for testing and review.

## üí° Key Features

### CRUD Operations:
- **Create**: Add new blog posts with title, content, category, and tags.
- **Retrieve**: Fetch specific blog posts or retrieve all available posts.
